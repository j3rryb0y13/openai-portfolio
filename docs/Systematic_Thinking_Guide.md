# 🧠 Systematic Thinking Guide

## 1. Phase Goal Alignment
- **Ask:** How does this task move me closer to the *phase goal*?
- **Anchor:** Connect today’s work to the bigger roadmap (Phase → Week → Task → Deliverable).

---

## 2. Systematic Layers
- **Conceptual Layer** → What is the idea? Why does it matter?
- **Practical Layer** → How can I try it (code, SQL, example, visualization)?
- **Meta-Reflection Layer** → How does this connect to past learning and future applications (portfolio, OpenAI/Anthropic roles, real-world use)?

---

## 3. Weekly Checklist
✅ Did I connect this task to the phase goal?  
✅ Did I build a practical example?  
✅ Did I document it in a reusable way (repo, notes, diagrams)?  
✅ Did I reflect on how it connects to past/future work?

## 4. Zoom In / Zoom Out Thinking
🔍 **Zoom In** → Work deeply on the current drill or concept.  
🌍 **Zoom Out** → Step back and ask: where does this fit in the system (data pipeline, ML workflow, portfolio project, or job role)?

## 5. Cycle of Improvement (PDCA Loop)
- **Plan → Do → Check → Adapt**  
- Each week = a mini-iteration.
